# Weather Station Project Requirements

The following are the general requirements for the weather station project:

1. The weather station should be designed as an open-source project, allowing for continuous development, customization of functionalities, and integration with other systems.
2. All components used in the weather station should be easily accessible and available for ordinary users to order.
3. The station should be designed with durability and weather resistance in mind, enabling long-term and reliable outdoor use.

## Sensors Requirements

The weather station should accurately measure the following parameters within their specified ranges:

|   |Parameter                          |Unit  |Range     |
|:--|:----------------------------------|:-----|:---------|
|1  |Temperature                        |°C    |-40 to 60 |
|2  |Humidity                           |%RH   |0 - 100   |
|3  |Pressure                           |hPa   |800 - 1100|
|4  |Wind Speed                         |m/s   |0 - 50    |
|5  |Wind Direction                     |rad   |0 - 360   |
|6  |Rain Gauge                         |mm/m² |0 - 100   |
|7  |UV (A/B/C)                         |μW/cm²|n/a       |
|8  |Ambient Light                      |lux   |0 - 200k  |
|9  |Air Quality (PM1 / PM2.5 / PM10)   |μg/m³ |0 - 1000  |

## Hardware Requirements

The weather station's hardware should meet the following requirements:

1. Processor and Power Management:
   - The device should be equipped with an energy-efficient processor or microcontroller that enables efficient power management.
   - The power management system should be optimized for minimal energy consumption, allowing for long-term operation on batteries or efficient utilization of available power sources.

2. Wireless Communication:
   - Wireless communication modules such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, or LoRa should be optimized for low energy consumption, enabling efficient data transmission with minimal impact on power resources.
   - The device should incorporate power management features for adjusting the transmission frequency and power as needed.

3. Sensors:
   - The selection of sensors should prioritize low energy consumption to minimize the impact on device energy efficiency.
   - Sensors with features like automatic wake-up or energy regulation should be preferred to activate them only when necessary.

4. Power Resource Management:
   - The device should have intelligent power resource management mechanisms, such as sleep mode or automatic shut-off of unused components, to minimize energy consumption during idle periods.
   - The software should include energy optimization algorithms to efficiently utilize power resources in different operational scenarios.

## Enclosure Requirements

The enclosure of the weather station should meet the following specifications:

1. The enclosure should be made of durable and weather-resistant material.
2. It should be sealed to provide protection against moisture, dust, and sun radiation.
3. All enclosure components, including structural elements and fittings, should be 3D-printable for cost-effective manufacturing and customization.

## Additional Requirements

1. The weather station should be designed for future integration with photovoltaic (PV) panels for power supply, though this functionality will not be implemented initially.
2. Remote software updates should be possible to facilitate easy enhancements and bug fixes.
