# Another Weather Station ;)

This weather station is a passion-driven open-source project aimed at providing accurate monitoring of atmospheric conditions. Please note that as a hobby project, it may contain errors or limitations in functionality. However, I will do my best to continuously improving and refining the station's capabilities.



## Sensors Requirements

The weather station should possess the capability to accurately measure the following parameters within their specified ranges.

|   |Parameter                  |Unit  |Range     |
|:--|:--------------------------|:-----|:---------|
|1  |Temperature                |°C    |-40 to 60 |
|2  |Humidity                   |%RH   |0 - 100   |
|3  |Preasure                   |hPa   |800 - 1100|
|4  |Wind Speed                 |m/s   |0 - 50    |
|5  |Wind Direction             |rad   |0 - 360   |
|6  |Rain Gauge                 |mm/m² |0 - 100   |
|5  |UV (A/B/C)                 |μW/cm²|n/a       |
|7  |Ambient Light              |lux   |0 - 200k  |
|8  |Dust (PM1 / PM2.5 / PM10)  |μg/m³ |0 - 1000  |
